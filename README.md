# Information-Risk-Management

As part of the MSc Cyber security course, I have completed this module and its coursework has been uploaded. The description of this module is provided below.

## Module Introduction
For all organisations, the need for recognising effective methods of information security management is paramount. With the technological advances of the workplace, businesses face new threats and vulnerabilities that have not previously been considered, such as recent cyber-attacks in the forms of phishing campaigns, denial of service, and ransomware.
 
In this module, we study the roles of information security management and information risk management. We look to understand the current landscape that businesses are faced with via real-world case studies, and study these in the context of the information security CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, availability). We introduce the terminology of threats, vulnerabilities, impact, and risk, to assess the likelihood and severity of security incidents. We consider the scope of external threats, such as global malware infection and political conflict, and also focus on insider threats, such as data theft or sabotage by those acting within the organisation, and discuss how such cases can be managed. We also examine how the International Organization for Standardization can facilitate the identification, analyse, and mitigation of risks. We consider in detail the information security management frameworks that are in the ISO 27000 family, to support the development of an Information Security Management System (ISMS). We also make use of the British Standards Institute to study related ISO documentation for risk management, include ISO 9000 and ISO 31000. We also study the relevant legislation, regulations, policy, that relate to information security, including the Computer Misuse Act, the Data Protection Act, and the more recent General Data Protection Regulation, to understand how this can protect individuals and businesses from the potential threats that exist. 

## Learning Outcomes

Form deep and systematic understanding of relevant tools, such as ISO27001 and FAIR, in the context of Information Security and Risk management.

Identify and analyse the broad range of real-world security issues that face commercial organisations and other institutions.

Evaluate and critique the shortcomings of real-world security incidents, and provide clear justification and innovative solutions for how ISMS could help mitigate future incidents, and how FAIR can help quantify and assess risk.

Assess and evaluate the appropriateness of security laws and regulations.

Reflect on personal capabilities of conducting Information Risk Management providing clear rationale for the methods adopted.
